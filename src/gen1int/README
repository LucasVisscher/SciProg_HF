1. A brief description of the project

   Gen1Int is a Fortran 90 library (with Python interface) to evaluate the
   derivatives of one-electron integrals with respect to the geometry perturbation,
   external electric and magnetic fields, and total rotational angular momentum
   at zero fields with contracted rotational London atomic orbitals (LAO).

   Please refer to doc/manual.pdf for more details.
   Please refer to RULES if you would like to contribute.
